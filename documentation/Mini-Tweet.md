# Mini-Tweet

The current Mini-tweet implementation allows following functionalities:

1. SignUp and Login
2. Follow and Block users
3. Post a Tweet
4. Retweet
5. Receive Feed
6. Supports HashTags
7. Supports Mentions

The addition of any functionality is now more of a database structuring and querying problem. The server-client response model is complete and can handle any kind of information transfer as required.
